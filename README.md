### Exercise 1: Multiplication Tables

ok.

### Exercise 2: More math

3.c. "Process is terminated due to StackOverflowException.". 420.000! is to big.
3.d. A recursive function is a function that calls itself.

### Exercice 3: Try/Catch

I don't use Math.Pow(x, 2) because it does not return me an error.
I think it was due to the type of the variable. when i use an 'int' i have an error. 
And with a 'double' there is no error.

### Exercice 4: Square

I skipped step one to directly make a square with stars.

### Exercice 5: Christmas Tree

I reused the code from Exercise 4 to decorate the tree. 
There are 30% chance of having an 'o' and 70% of 'i'. 
So there is a probability of having more 'o' than 'i'
